  <h1 id="cover.label">ePub Cover Pronghorn</h1>
  <p>Traditionally the American Society of Mammalogists has used a Pronghorn (<span class="taxon">Antilocapra americana</span>) as its &#8216;branding&#8217;
(Timm and McLaren <a href="bibliography.xhtml#timm_mclaren-2019" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"><time>2019</time> page 1</a>).</p>
  <p>In keeping with that tradition, Pipfrosch Press has chosen to use a photograph of a Pronghorn provided by wildlife and carnivore ecologist Tyus D. Williams.</p>
  <p>Tyus is a graduate of the University of Georgia and has research and field experience with the University of Nevada (Reno), the Georgia Sea Turtle Center (Jekyll Island), and Virginia Tech with the Jaguar Research Project in Belize, Central America; amongst other projects.</p>
  <p>Tyus is also very passionate with Science Communication (often abbreviated <abbr>SciComm</abbr>) where he works with <a href="https://twitter.com/Cougar_Network" title="Internet Resource">The Cougar Network</a>, is the founder of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SciQFriday" title="Internet Resource">#SciQFriday</a>, and participates in the very important <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackInSTEM">#BlackInSTEM</a> social media science communication revolution. A quote of his that sums up his passion for Science Communication:</p>
  <blockquote>As a science communicator, I firmly believe that we cannot fully harness the intellectual merits of science without engaging the public in an inclusive effort. Progression occurs when all voices are heard!</blockquote>
  <p>That quotation resonates very strongly with me and one of my motivations behind Pipfrosch Press.</p>
  <p>The reader is <em>strongly</em> encouraged to visit his website at:<br />
